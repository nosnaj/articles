## We need articles, what are we looking for?

#### Content contributors we're looking for

* One off article
* Series (weekly, monthly...) about a certain topic
* Cross posting (we're glad to mirror posts with proper attribution)

## We're looking for the following contents

### Technical

* Tutorial
* Guide
* Snippets with explanation
* Technical user group introduction
* Project introduction

### Non Technical

* News, especially about the industry
* Business related (tips and tricks or experience sharing)

*As of now, we don't have much guidelines yet, but posts will be moderated*

Short series (<1000 words) are welcomed.

Next up, we'll cover how to start submitting articles.
