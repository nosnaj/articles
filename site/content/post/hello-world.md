## Hello, World! But it doesn't stop here.

**Engineers.My** is a public working group, aims to build an **open source** platform for learning, sharing and collaboration.

#### The current goals

* Cross pollination and collaboration between different technical groups
* Advertise local open source projects
* Curation of local tech news and meetups
* Technical articles
* Newsletter

#### What this movement is not about

* To replace technical groups
* Yet another chat room
* Not a meetup group, not the priority for now

#### What we need help for

* Homepage design
* Article contribution
* Design works

Details will be coming soon, for now, ping the folks on Slack for more.
