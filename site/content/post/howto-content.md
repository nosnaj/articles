## Content creators, get ready

### The gory details

We're still figuring out the CMS, right now, it's hosted [here](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles).

It is a static site powered by [Hugo](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The posts are hosted at the git repo's *content* directory.

As of now, the short term goal is to move to [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms).

Opinions are welcomed.

# TLDR

There is no easy way to submit your articles yet :(

For those who adapt with Markdown and Git, you can submit a pull request to the article repo [https://github.com/engineersmy/articles](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles).

For those who are not, you can ping us on the Slack channel [https://engineersmy.herokuapp.com](https://engineersmy.herokuapp.com).

For now, we can do the editing and publishing for you.
