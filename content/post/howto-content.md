## Content creators, get ready

### The gory details

We are using Netlify CMS [here](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles).

For those wants to hack with this [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms).

It is a static site powered by [Hugo](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles) hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The posts are hosted at the git repo's **site/content** directory.

Opinions are welcomed.

## How to publish

For those who adapt with Markdown and Git, you can submit a pull request to the article repo [https://github.com/engineersmy/articles](https://github.com/engineersmy/articles).

You can also login to the [admin](https://articles.engineers.my/admin/) dashboard via your Github account.

We are ready to help with editing and publishing.

Things are still a bit tough right now.
